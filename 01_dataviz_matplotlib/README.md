### Projects

Project: [Sublime Limes Line Graphs](https://github.com/davidlweiss/code-data/blob/master/01_dataviz_matplotlib/project_matplotlib_sublime_limes.ipynb)

Description: Making "lime" graphs for a produce company.
* Using subplots to display page visits and individual product sales by month in one figure with titles, labeled axes, and customized axis ticks.
* Displaying page visits by month and total lime sales on one graph with 2 y-axes, using list comprehensions to complete.

Project: [Math Teacher Visualizations](https://github.com/davidlweiss/code-data/blob/master/01_dataviz_matplotlib/project_math-teacher-visualizations.ipynb)

Description: act as a math teacher and create various plots to understand class performance. 
* Bar chart with error for final exam averages by year
* Side by side bar plot for different schools exam scores
* Grade distribution using stacked bar chart
* Dual histograms breaking down final exam scores for year 1 teaching vs. year 2 teaching
* Labeled pie chart to determine percent breakout of which topics students thought were hardest. 
* Shaded line chart to display the relationship between self-reported study hours and final exam scores assuming 20% error
